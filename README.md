## Projects


### 1. [Egypt House Pricing](https://github.com/mazennh/Egypt_House_Price_Prediction)
‚óè **Description:**  Developed a predictive model to estimate house 
prices in Egypt based on various factors such as location, size, 
amenities, and market trends. The project aimed to provide
accurate price predictionsto help buyers and real estate 
agents make informed decisions.  

‚óè **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, 
Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, and Seaborn 

‚óè **Outcome:**  The project enhanced the accuracy of price
estimations by [insert percentage, if applicable], contributing 
to more data-driven decisions in the real estate market.

### 2. [Linear Regression Implementation with Gradient Descent and Early Stopping](https://github.com/mazennh/Gradient-Descent)

‚óè **Description:**  Independently implemented Softmax Regression 
with gradient descent optimization and early stopping to 
solve multi-class classification problems, enhancing model 
performance and preventing overfitting.  

‚óè **Tools Used:**  Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, 
Jupyter Notebook. 

‚óè **Outcome:** Successfully applied a robust Softmax Regression 
model with gradient descent and early stopping to the Iris 
dataset, demonstrating expertise in optimization techniques 
and regularization methods for machine learning

### 3. [Softmax Regression Implementation](https://github.com/mazennh/Gradient-Descent)

‚óè **Description:** Developed a Linear Regression model from 
scratch using gradient descent optimization with early 
stopping, focusing on enhancing the model's performance 
and preventing overfitting. 

‚óè **Tools Used:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, 
Jupyter Notebook.  

‚óè **Outcome:** Successfully implemented a Linear Regression 
model with gradient descent and early stopping, deepening 
my knowledge of optimization techniques and enhancing my 
ability to build robust, generalizable models.
